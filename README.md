# Convex-Optimization

Gerogia Institute of Technology ECE 6270 course. Refer to http:http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/ece-6270-spring2021/
if you are interested in mathmatical theory. Note that it's my instructor(Mark Davenport)'s website. And I run all
the code on JupyterLab or Pycharm on MAC OS.

This file includes homework, of course includes some codes beyond the homework(Other visualization),
and I will keep updating it about some mathmatical theories about convex optimization.
Note that all the homeworks have been encrypted, **anyone wants to violate GT's Academic Honor Integrity will be punished**.

The mainly contains some **realization of mathmatical theories** about convex optimization. The contents are as follows,
## Introduction to optimization, basic geometric and algebraic concepts
## Convexity
* convex sets
* convex functions
* convexity, gradients, and optimization
## Unconstrained optimization
* gradient descent
* line search methods
* convergence analysis
* accelerated first order methods (Heavy ball, Neseterov)
* Newton's method
