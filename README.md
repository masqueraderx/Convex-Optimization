# Convex-Optimization

Gerogia Institute of Technology ECE 6254 course. Refer to http:http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/ece-6270-spring2021/
if you are interested in mathmatical theory. Note that it's my instructor(Mark Davenport)'s website. And I run it on JupyterLab on MAC OS.

This file includes homework, of course includes some codes beyond the homework(Other visualization of machine learning),
and I will keep updating it about some mathmatical theories about convex optimization.
Note that all the homeworks have been encrypted, **anyone wants to violate GT's Academic Honor Integrity will be punished**.
